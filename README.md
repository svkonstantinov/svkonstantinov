## Background and Current Activity
I am a researcher with a focus on optimization problems, robotics, mechanical systems and control theory.

My work combines applied mathematics with practical problem-solving in mechatronics and automation. I focus on developing new approaches for dynamic systems, control algorithms and robotic applications, using a multidisciplinary perspective to tackle engineering challenges.

In addition to my research, I am an Associate Professor at RUDN University, where I engage in both teaching and scientific work. My interests extend beyond robotics, including machine learning, AI-driven text processing and data science. I also work on practical applications of AI, such as image classification and object recognition using deep learning models.  

I am always open to collaboration and enjoy working on innovative projects that bridge engineering, automation, and artificial intelligence. ðŸš€
